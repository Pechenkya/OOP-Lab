## Task
Fully functional and operable Matrix class.

Project plan:
- [x] Basic matrix constructors and destructor
- [x] Basic matrix operations
- [x] Basic matrix operators

### To think about

Some functionality could be useless for most of types and classes, so maybe remove templates and leave just double?
